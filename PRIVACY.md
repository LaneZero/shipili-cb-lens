# Privacy Policy for Shipili CB-Lens



Effective Date: November 24, 2025



This Privacy Policy describes how Shipili CB-Lens ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension.



1\. Data Collection and Usage

Shipili CB-Lens is designed with privacy as a priority. We do not collect, store, share, or sell any of your personal data.



&nbsp;  No Tracking: We do not track your browsing history, search queries, or website usage.

&nbsp;  No Analytics: We do not use third-party analytics software (such as Google Analytics) to track extension usage.

&nbsp;  No Remote Servers: The extension functions entirely locally on your device. No data is transmitted to external servers.



2\. Local Storage

The extension uses the browser's local storage API (chrome.storage.local) solely for the purpose of remembering your preferences. The following non-personal data is stored locally on your machine:

&nbsp;  Status: Whether the filter is ON or OFF.

&nbsp;  Mode: The selected color blindness type (e.g., Protanopia).

&nbsp;  Intensity: The numerical value of the filter intensity slider.



This data never leaves your browser and is deleted if you uninstall the extension.



3\. Permissions

The extension requires access to web pages (<all\_urls> or Host Permissions) strictly to inject the color correction filter (SVG Matrix) into the websites you visit. This access is technical and is not used to read or collect the content of the pages you visit.



4\. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
